ImmersedBoundary - ImmersedBoundary Simulations at ICS
=====================================================================

ICS ImmersedBoundary module supposed to be couple with Impact
The module can be loaded in whale framework.

Technical comments:
immersed_boundary.mk is needed to have mechanics as a MOOSE module. ( *.o;  *.opt ;  *.d  files created).
The Makefile is needed to have a stand alone MOOSE-based application ( executable  mech-opt and  *.opt ;  *.d  files created).
